# Find the Highest/Lowest Frequency Element

## Problem Statement
Given an array of size N, find the elements with the highest and lowest frequencies.

### Pre-requisite
- Hashing Theory
- Counting frequencies of array elements

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: array[] = {10, 5, 10, 15, 10, 5}
Output: 10 15
```
**Explanation:** The frequency of 10 is 3 (highest) and the frequency of 15 is 1 (lowest).

### Example 2
```
Input: array[] = {2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 2}
Output: 2 3
```
**Explanation:** The frequency of 2 is 3 (highest) and the frequency of 3 is 1 (lowest).
