# Move All Zeros To The End

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, write a program to move all zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
**Input:** 
```
[1, 0, 2, 3, 0, 4, 0, 1]
```
**Output:** 
```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```
**Explanation:** All zeros are moved to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.

#### Example 2:
**Input:** 
```
[1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 4, 0]
```
**Output:** 
```
[1, 2, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0]
```
**Explanation:** All zeros are moved to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.

## Task
Write a solution that satisfies the following requirements:
- Move all zeros to the end of the array
- Maintain the relative order of non-zero elements
- Modify the array in-place
