# Find the Repeating and Missing Numbers

## Problem Description
Given an array of N integers containing numbers from 1 to N, find:
- A number that appears twice (A)
- A number that is missing (B)

The array is read-only and contains integers in the range [1, N].

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** 
```
arr = [3, 1, 2, 5, 3]
```
**Can you find:**
- The number that appears twice?
- The missing number?

### Example 2
**Input:**
```
arr = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 5]
```
**Can you find:**
- The number that appears twice?
- The missing number?

## Notes
- Array is read-only
- All numbers are in range [1, N]
- Only one number is repeated
- Only one number is missing

## Challenge
Try solving this problem with:
- O(1) extra space
- O(N) time complexity
