# Find the Majority Element

Given an array of N integers, write a program to return an element that occurs more than N/2 times in the given array. You may consider that such an element always exists in the array.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** N = 3, nums[] = [3,2,3]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** When we count the occurrences of each number and compare with half of the array size, 3 appears more than N/2 times.

### Example 2
**Input:** N = 7, nums[] = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** 2 appears more than N/2 times in the array.

### Example 3
**Input:** N = 10, nums[] = [4,4,2,4,3,4,4,3,2,4]  
**Output:** 4  
**Explanation:** 4 appears more than N/2 times in the array.
