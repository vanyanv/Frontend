# Sort Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s

## Problem Statement

Given an array consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s, write a program to sort the array in-place without using any built-in sort functions.

### Constraints:
- Must be solved in a single pass (O(N) time complexity)
- Must use constant space (O(1) space complexity)
- Do not use any built-in sort functions

### Examples:

```javascript
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### Notes:
- Array contains only 0s, 1s, and 2s
- Array must be sorted in ascending order
- Modification should be done in-place
