# Rearrange Array Elements by Sign

## Problem Description

Given an array `A` of size `N` with an equal number of positive and negative elements, rearrange the array alternately with positive and negative values while maintaining the relative order of elements.

## Task Requirements

- Start the array with positive elements
- Maintain the relative order of positive and negative elements
- The array contains an equal number of positive and negative integers
- Return the rearranged array with alternating positive and negative numbers

## Examples

JavaScript examples are provided in the solution file.

## Constraints

- Array contains equal number of positive and negative elements
- Original relative order must be preserved
- Array must start with a positive number

## Input Format

- First line contains integer N (size of array)
- Second line contains N space-separated integers

## Output Format

Array with alternating positive and negative integers maintaining relative order

## Note

The implementation should handle various test cases while preserving the ordering rules mentioned above.
