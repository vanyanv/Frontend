# Kadane's Algorithm: Maximum Subarray Sum

Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum in an array and return its sum.

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `arr`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum. Return the sum and print the subarray.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** 
```
arr = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
```

**Output:** 
```
6
```

**Explanation:** 
The subarray `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum = 6.

### Example 2:

**Input:** 
```
arr = [1]
```

**Output:** 
```
1
```

**Explanation:** 
Array has only one element which gives a sum of 1.
