# Longest Subarray with Given Sum K (Positives)

## Problem Description
Given an array of positive integers and a target sum k, find the length of the longest subarray that sums to k.

## Examples

### Example 1:
```
Input: 
- N = 3
- k = 5
- array[] = {2,3,5}

Output: 2

Explanation: 
The longest subarray with sum 5 is {2, 3}, with length 2.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input:
- N = 5
- k = 10
- array[] = {2,3,5,1,9}

Output: 3

Explanation:
The longest subarray with sum 10 is {2, 3, 5}, with length 3.
```

## Problem Constraints
- Array contains positive integers only
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ array[i] ≤ 10^5
- 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5
