# Selection Sort

## Problem Description
Selection Sort is a fundamental sorting algorithm. Your task is to implement the Selection Sort algorithm with the following requirements:

### Input
- An array of unsorted numbers
- The array can contain both positive and negative integers
- The array length can vary from 0 to n elements

### Expected Output
- Return the array sorted in ascending order
- The original array should be modified in-place

### Example
```
Input: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
```

### Points to Consider
1. How would you handle an empty array?
2. What is the time complexity of your solution?
3. Can you optimize the number of swaps?
4. How does the algorithm perform with duplicate elements?

## Files
- `Selection-Sort.ts`: Implement your solution in this file.

## Constraints
- Do not use any built-in sort functions
- Focus on in-place sorting
- Consider memory efficiency

Good luck with your implementation!
