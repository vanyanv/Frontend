# The Great Frontend: Custom Tests

Welcome to **The Great Frontend: Custom Tests** project! This repository contains a collection of frontend questions sourced from [The Great Frontend](https://www.thegreatfrontend.com/), each paired with a unique test designed to evaluate and enhance your skills in various frontend technologies and concepts.

## Project Overview

In this project, we take questions from **The Great Frontend** and create tailored tests for each. These tests are meant to provide hands-on practice and challenge frontend developers of all levels. Each test is built around key concepts that are essential for mastering frontend development, such as:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals
- React, Vue, and other frameworks
- Accessibility
- Responsive design
- Performance optimization
- Advanced concepts like state management and hooks

## How It Works

For each question from **The Great Frontend**, we've created a corresponding test file. Each test includes:

- **Question Overview**: A description of the frontend question or challenge.
- **Test Instructions**: Steps and guidelines to complete the task.
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Key points that your solution will be evaluated on.
- **Sample Solutions** (optional): Example solutions for reference.

You can clone the repository and attempt each test in the order of your choice.
